            The National Academies report has a detailed <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/25259/chapter/7">chapter</a> on DAC if you want to read more.

            Chemical direct air capture machines are not some crazy new technology. They have been used on submarines and space stations for quite some time, and you can even <a href="https://www.environmental-expert.com/products/carbon-dioxide-co2-air-scrubbers-314565">buy one</a> (for your underground bunker or whatever).

            Interestingly it <a href="https://elidourado.com/blog/dawn-of-geoengineering/">seems</a> that <a href="https://www.prometheusfuels.com/">Prometheus Fuels</a> may have a more energy efficient way to electrolytically generate fuel, specifically for the part dealing with the separation of the generated fuel from the surrounding water — this kind of thing could be fantastic for jet fuel specifically, which is otherwise difficult to decarbonize.)
			</span> 

            The idea has a long history. A group including Freeman Dyson, from <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/6385084#page=121">1977</a>, cites a <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/4580336">1965</a> proposal by Beller and Steinberg. This was an era when people were <b>bullish on abundant nuclear energy, and they proposed to use this energy to extract CO2 from the air to produce chemical fuel such as methanol locally for the army</b>, by reacting adsorbed CO2 with hydrogen generated electrolytically from water. They estimated a need for 5700 processing plants, each burning 1 GigaWatt, to compensate for emissions. That’s about 6 TeraWatts or about ⅓ of civilization’s current global energy consumption.
            <br></br><br></br>
            This <a href="https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/770509">paper</a>, by Klaus Lackner, covers the basic physics of carbon capture really well, e.g., how long an absorption column for CO2 needs to be, and so on. He also explains why some chemical capture approaches may be more energy efficient (not to mention much more land efficient) than biological capture approaches: 
            <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
			<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
			<span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
            Same for any other approach that generates an energy-dense fuel
			</span> 

            “Biomass generation is, however, a very inefficient approach because it is coupled with the reduction of the carbon which requires as much energy as was released in the combustion”.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Lackner also explains where the energy requirement actually shows up (we know it must show up somewhere from the thermodynamics argument above) in these processes:

            </p>
            <blockquote>
				<p>
                “Most of the energy demand for an absorption process is in the recovery of the absorbent”.

				</p>
			</blockquote>

            <p>
            In other words, getting the CO2 back off of the thing it stuck to. What is then the main reason why we can’t easily reach the ideal thermodynamic limit above? Lacker explains:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
				<p>
                “In practice, most effective absorbents will bind much more strongly then is required strictly by thermodynamic considerations.”

				</p>
			</blockquote>
            <p>
            <label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle">&#8853;</label>
			<input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/>
			<span class="marginnote" id="id_option">
            In the paper, Lacker proposes industrial facilities to generate CaCO3 bricks by reacting CO2 with Ca(OH)2, which would then be recycled to continue the process. Recycling the Calcium to re-run this process then consumes much of the energy. The binding energy to the absorber is about 8 times too high in this case, compared what would be needed to approach the thermodynamic limit.

			</span> 

            In practice, basically one needs to heat the carbon-capturing materials to cause them to give back their captured CO2, and this heating is where the energy is needed — and, because the binding to the material is stronger than it absolutely needs to be thermodynamically, you pay extra energy for the heating. So, we have understood the fundamentals of carbon capture!

            <b>Land use</b>
            <br></br><br></br>
            Trees are great and all, but planting enough trees would take up a large land area all across the world. <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/jennifer_wilcox_a_new_way_to_remove_co2_from_the_atmosphere/transcript?language=en">Direct air capture using industrial facilities</a> would have a much smaller land area footprint, and would arguably have a much smaller ecological footprint overall. Here is an image of it from the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/2y36ngfrcbpv37f/EFI%20Clearing%20the%20Air%20Full%20Report.pdf?dl=0">recent EFI report</a>:

            </div>
            <br></br><br></br>
            To convince ourselves of the landuse differences we can do a dumb back of the envelope calculation for this. Suppose you need to capture 10 GtCO2 per year. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            We can first figure out roughly what % of the mass of a given unit of air CO₂ is. The atmosphere is mostly N2 which weighs 28 g/mol, CO2 weights 44 g/mol so at 410ppm we can roughly state that  (410*44 / (1e6 * 28)) = 0.064% of the atmosphere's mass comes from CO₂. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            We can then use V=M/density to get that V=10Gt/(density of air*0.00064) = 1e16 m^3 of air processed per year.

            If your single DAC plant processes 100 m^3 per second of air and takes up the size of a football field, then our total area of DAC plants needs to be: 5 million acres, or 6x the total area of Rhode Island.

                <p>
                Lackner and Allen B. Wright have <a href="https://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/04/prweb519808.htm">started a company</a> called Global Research Technologies to work on this. As the Scientific American article explained, “Lackner and his partner, Allen B. Wright of Global Research Technologies (GRT) in Tucson, Ariz., have developed a proprietary plastic that grabs CO2 from the atmosphere the way flypaper grabs flies. When the CO2-enriched plastic is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGL21j10C8Q">rinsed with water vapor</a>, a stream of pure CO2 forms that can be sequestered underground”.
                <br></br><br></br>
                (Incidentally, another potential <a href="http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/davidkeith/files/51.keith_.2005.climatestratwithaircapture.e.pdf">process</a> is sodium hydroxide (NaOH) + water to absorb CO2, then recycle the alkaline NaOH by addition of lime (CaO) to make calcium carbonate, which is then heated to recycle the lime.)

                <p>
                David Keith et al also have a startup on this, called <a href="http://carbonengineering.com/">Carbon Engineering</a>. It appears they are using a refinement of the Lackner process. From a recent <a href="https://keith.seas.harvard.edu/files/tkg/files/keith_et_al._-_2018_-_a_process_for_capturing_co2_from_the_atmosphere.pdf">paper</a>: 
                <br></br><br></br>
                “As with any industrial technology, there is a sharp distinction between the ease of developing “paper” designs and the difficulty of developing an operating plant. To paraphrase Rickover: an academic plant is simple, cheap, and uses off-the-shelf components; whereas, a practical plant is complicated, expensive, and “is requiring an immense amount of development on apparently trivial items.”24 [Carbon Engineering] has now spent roughly 100 person-years on such apparently trivial items to develop a process proposed almost two decades ago by Klaus Lackner and collaborators…”
                <br></br><br></br>
                Their proposed 94 to 232 $/t-CO2 is very expensive, however: to do <b>30 gigatons per year is 3 trillion dollars per year</b>, about 4% of world GDP. Still, this is much lower than previous estimates. 
                <br></br><br></br>
                Where is Carbon Engineering going to get the energy inputs to this process? One option is to burn natural gas, but do so cleanly, using the same type of carbon capture chemistry they use for ambient air capture to simultaneously sequester CO2 from the burning of the natural gas and thus stay strongly net-negative. This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XY_lzonfE3I">TED talk</a> suggests that that is what they are doing. (One recent paper <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2019/se/c9se00384c#!divAbstract">proposed</a> to derive the energy from bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) which would make the overall process even more strongly CO2 net-negative.)

                Another company in the space, called <a href="https://globalthermostat.com/">Global Thermostat</a>, thinks they can bring it to $50 per tonne of CO2. They have some estimates online of what their system can do: “20-500 tonnes of CO2/yr/m^2 or more, depending on the embodiment used”. This is to be compared with <a href="https://www.co2.earth/global-co2-emissions">emissions</a> of 35.9 GtCO2 of carbon dioxide per year.  So to offset current emissions, we need, assuming an embodiment with 200 tonnes of CO2/yr/m^2, to have a total area of a square 14 kilometers on a side, or 44 km on a side if it only captures 20 tonnes CO2 per yr per m^2. Let’s call it 100 km on a side conservatively, about the area of the state of Connecticut. Here is a <a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es102797w">paper</a> from this group, and some <a href="https://grist.org/article/direct-air-carbon-capture-global-thermostat/">discussion</a> of the economics.

                In any case, commercial efforts in this space currently seem like a way to increase the “tech readiness level” proactively, anticipating a larger-scale effort later on, for instance with policy changes that put a price on CO2 emissions and improve the economics. Richard Branson has a <a href="https://www.virginearth.com/">prize</a> offering for a commercially viable large-scale effort in this area, which has yet to be awarded. (Back of the envelope says it is just possible. An industry roughly the size of the automotive industry would do it.)

            <h2>Markets</h2>
            <p>
            One way emerging technologies have scaled in the past is to take on a series of niche markets that have a higher willingness to pay for some good than the average customer. By serving one niche market an industry can scale and hopefully reduce costs until it becomes attractive for other larger markets. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            If we look at the current costs of DAC then <a href="https://qz.com/1321073/the-seemingly-illogical-reason-europe-is-running-low-on-carbon-dioxide-and-thus-beer/">this article</a> suggests it could be profitable in some industries currently, but <a href="https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/accelerating-uptake-ccs-industrial-use-captured-carbon-dioxide/2-co2-market">this website</a>, suggests that CO2 is often currently bought at much lower costs than even the cheapest DAC options.
            <br></br><br></br>
            The total market at the moment is &lt;1/100th of global emissions, and there are other low priced sources, although there was recently a shortage. It is also worth pointing out that carbon markets on average have priced CO2 at only $10/ton, which sets a high bar for profitability of capture approaches.
            <br></br><br></br>
            Most governments, it seems, aren’t propping up carbon markets successfully at this point, and most current policy interventions aren’t really carbon taxes (e.g., there is an equivalent of a $1000/ton CO2 subsidy for electric cars in Norway, where if you go to Oslo nearly every other car is a Tesla). As mentioned in the previous post, France had a fuel tax of about $60/ton CO2 equivalent, but when Macron tried to double that over the next 4 years, the Yellow Vest protests happened. Canada <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/oct/26/canada-passed-a-carbon-tax-that-will-give-most-canadians-more-money">did</a> pass a carbon tax starting at below that level and rising to near it over a few years (“start low at $20 per ton in 2019, rising at $10 per ton per year until reaching $50 per ton in 2022”). And see the <a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/can-updated-tax-credits-make-carbon-capture-mainstream#gs.IF0YsSYw">45Q</a> tax credit program in the USA. So there is recent progress and I think reason for hope that the economics will work out here.

            <a href="https://www.diamandis.com/blog/direct-air-capture">This post</a> explores some of the broader potential applications of captured carbon.

			</span> 

            New markets for carbon also seem interesting in this context, at least as a way of jump-starting the economies of scale in the field, e.g., the company <a href="http://www.blueplanet-ltd.com/">Blue Planet</a> is using captured carbon for building and highway materials. According to their marketing, “If every new building for the next 30 years was made with the resulting product, humans could erase the globe-warming pollution they’ve sent into the atmosphere, said Fiekowsky…”.

            <Collapsible trigger="Electrofuels">

            One potentially massive market is in making carbon neutral fuels. You remove CO₂ from from the atmosphere using DAC and then you can can combine this with hydrogen
            to create various hydrocarbons (aka fuels) with some oxygen, and often water, as the byproducts.
             
            Prometheus Fuels, among others, wishes to take atmospheric CO2 all the way back into a fuel, which is going to cost an energy at least equal to the heat of combustion of the fuel, not to mention that associated with the concentration of the CO2 from the atmosphere. Still, this could be useful for fuels like jet fuel, that are otherwise difficult to decarbonize. I was a bit surprised, but it is not actually in principle crazy to make gasoline this way even with the higher say 1000 kJ/mole energy requirement: if a gallon of gas requires/releases 20 lbs of CO2, and energy cost 5 cents per kWh, then we have a cost per gallon of 20 lbs / (44 grams per mole) * (1000 kJ / mole) * 5 cents per kWh = $2.86 / gallon, which is not an unreasonable gas price, and this closely matches what was said about this project. See also here. Beyond actually making fuel from direct air captured CO2, there is also the idea of simply offsetting the use of the fuel with direct air capture. Stephen Pacala in this interview by Elizabeth Kolbert explains the rationale for this latter nicely:

            <b>Market conclusions</b>
            <br></br><br></br>
            I’m still trying to grok the projected business models for direct air capture, and at which cost thresholds it would be able to reach which levels of scale. Perhaps if CO2 is efficiently converted to certain specific forms like fuels, and in an economic environment with appropriate taxes on carbon emissions, or specifically on dirty fuels, it could be cost competitive — this seems to be Carbon Engineering’s plan. For large-scale deployment at the scale of the overall CO2 problem, the economics is at the forefront, and the economic incentives imposed collectively by society through carbon taxes and related mechanisms would be key, but see the previous paragraph regarding recent progress on this. 
            <br></br><br></br>
            Overall, although some have been <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/108/51/20428">skeptical</a> of the cost scaling of industrial direct air capture, there is an impressive amount of startup activity in the space. The <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05938-3">Lawrence paper</a> points out that truly widespread use of direct air capture may not naturally be employed anytime soon, since a more efficient approach would be to do carbon capture and storage directly at the output of fossil fuel burning power plants. But this is still a good way to get the technology moving… and commitments like the one made by <a href="https://stripe.com/gb/blog/negative-emissions-commitment">Stripe</a> could help bootstrap the field.
